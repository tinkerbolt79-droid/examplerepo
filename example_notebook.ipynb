            "\n",
            "* Sunlight isn’t just white light. It's actually made up of *all* the colors of the rainbow – red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.\n",

            "**3. Rayleigh Scattering:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* This is where things get interesting. Rayleigh scattering describes how light is scattered by particles that are *much smaller* than the wavelength of the light.\n",
            "* **Shorter wavelengths are scattered more strongly.** Blue and violet light have shorter wavelengths than other colors like red and orange. Because of this, they’re scattered *much* more intensely in all directions by the air molecules.\n",

            "\n",
            "* While violet light is scattered even *more* than blue, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light. Also, the sun emits slightly less violet light than blue light.  As a result, blue light is the color we perceive most strongly when looking up at the sky.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Think of it like this:** Imagine throwing different sized balls at a bumpy surface. Smaller balls (blue light) will bounce off in all directions more easily than larger balls (red light).\n",

This longer path causes almost all of the blue light to be scattered away *before* it reaches us. The longer wavelengths – red and orange – are less affected by scattering and can pass through the atmosphere, giving us those beautiful sunset colors.\n",
